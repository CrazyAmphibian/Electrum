<h3>Gameplay Effects</h3>
personal lab when picked up summons a portal above it leading to a lab area. Additionally, all future holy mountains will feature a portal to the lab as well, and a portal will appear near the mountain altar. These portals may be re-entered any number of times.

<h3>The Alchemy Lab</h3>
The alchemy lab contains 6 vats for alchemy and storage, a pool of water to wash stains off, a portal at the top left to leave, a distillation setup, and a sloped reaction area for hard to mix materials, as well as several areas to store items, and providing the player with 5 empty potions and pouches.<br>
The vats are made out of dense steel - so they will not be damaged by acid, lava, or concentrated mana. The floors of the vats are just thin enough the levitating against them with a potion held up will fill the potion.<br>

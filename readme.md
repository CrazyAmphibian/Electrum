## Contributing

### bugs
bugs can be reported by opening an issue and using the bug report template. please be as descriptive as possible. images or video can do wonders. if you're using other mods, they may be relevant.

### requests
features requests can be done by opening an issue and using the feature request template. You can also open a blank issue if your aim is a more general discussion about the design. Overall, your feature should seek to solve a problem (be it fun or balance) in a reasonable way. Please keep feature requests limited to 1 set of features per request. you can always open more, and it helps a lot with organization.

### additions
If you want to make changes to the mod, you first need to fork the repository, make changes on your branch, then open a pull request with those changes. Make sure to keep to the template. Features should be atomic, meaning they should only affect 1 thing at a time. if your PR changes several things at once, it will be closed. Additionally, the bare minimum of coding standards are expected. your code should be readable and easy to change later. comments are appreciated, but are not required.

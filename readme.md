## Materials

**Aqua regia**

	made by combining any kind of polymorph with acid. used with other alchemical reactions.

**Electrum**

	the namesake of the mod. made by combining silver, gold, and aqua regia. Used in alchemy
	
**Blood mixture**

	a combination of worm blood and blood. will form very slowly when the two interact. can be sped up with aqua regia. can be reverted into it's parts with slime.
	Gives both effects of the bloods when ingested and stained.

**Hot chocolate**

	when ingested gives some damage resistance. made by combining chocolate and water
	
**chocolate **

	can also be ingested, but is weaker than the liquid. Make with electrum and soil
	
**Destabilized polymorph**

	made by combining polymorphine with aqua regia. Precursor to something great. Poisonous.
	
**Antipolymoprph fluid**

	combine destabilized polymorph with electrum. annihilates with any polymorph. can be drank to give brief  polymorph immunity (2 seconds per drink/10% of a potion). Poisonous.
	
	the polymorph immunity is very short to maintain some balance, so it's hard to make a lot and use it pre-emptively. intended to be used reactively to attacks and situations. probably won't stop you from doing so, though...

**other reactions**

	combine blood mixture, electrum, and concentrated mana to make berserkium
	pour aqua regia on berserkium to make it into concentrated mana.
	aqua regia + sulphur = gunpowder. finaly sulphur has a use!
	sulphur + blood mix = honey.
	blood mix + soil = grass (or fungus if you use fungal soil)
	blood + pheromone = worm pherromone + worm pherromone
	ominous liquid + electrum = acceleratium + poison gas
	unstable polymorphine + electrum = polymorphine + smoke

## mod interaction

* reactions between destabalized polymorph and frozen creepy polymorph (re-activates it)
* reactions between aqua regia and a few materials (play and find out)

**OVERCAST:**
